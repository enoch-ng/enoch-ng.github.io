Hi, I'm Enoch. I'm also referred to as Eve in a lot of contexts and I've grown equally accustomed to that name, so either is fine as a way to refer to me.

I graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2020, and while I was there I spent much of my time arranging for, preparing for, and participating in musical performances, mostly featuring covers of music from popular culture including anime and video games.

This site was originally here to serve as a portfolio for my work more on the professional side of things and showcase my personal projects but I haven't used it for that purpose in a long time, and it turns out there's not a great way to access all my arrangements.

Since I take no small amount of pride in them, I think it makes more sense to let this website serve primarily as a repository for high-quality, mostly accurate transcriptions and arrangements of video game music.
